# Discord-Bot
Discord Bot that replies world to hello message


Before cloning the repository, make sure to create a new application from Discord Developer Portal -> </br>
Make sure to give your application unique name, otherwise it will be throwing errors -> </br>
After that, create a new bot -> </br>
In bot configs change all the intents to true, otherwise your code will NOT reply to message, or will throw a [DISALLOWED INTENTS] error -> </br>
In General reset your token and add it in .env file (Simply, replace 'your token goes here' to your token) -> </br>
After that, in OAuth2 generate new URL to add your bot to the channel, paste it in your browser and select where you would like to add it </br>
</br>

That's it :)
